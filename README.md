## What is it
This website is dynamic, and allows users to browse for attractions and hotels. They can then filter their results by location, price, indoor, outdoor, category, and mask protocols. Beyond that, you can also contact our team to get more information about a particular attraction. Be sure to check out the Frequently Asked Questions first!

### Home
The `Home` page describes what the website and Central Texas have to offer as well as navigation for the user. The menu bar located at the top of the page allows users to quickly move through the different parts of the website. The user can also view upcoming events from the current month.

### Attractions
The `Attractions` page displays various attractions. Using the bar to the left, users can select checkboxes to filter their results. Make sure to click the `Update Preferences` button at the bottom of the bar in order for your selection to work. When you select a checkbox, all activities of that type will be displayed, regardless of the other preferences chosen. Located underneath the `Update Preferences` button, there is also the `Clear Preferences` button to clear your selection. On the page itself, you will see individual blocks containing the name, an image, a blurb, and other details relating to the event. Users can search for specific attractions as well.

### Contact
The `Contact` page can be used to send an email to our team. General inquiries about attractions and the user's visit are welcome. The web page does not store the user's name or email, so there is no need to worry about the user's information being open to malicious hackers. You can read more about it through our [privacy policy](http://localhost:81/extra/privacy.php) Error messages will display below the `Send Mail` button if the input does not meet requirements.

### Bottom Bar
This Bar exists at the bottom of all the pages in the website. It contains links to the about page, sitemap, and privacy policy. Our about page has information on visitor centers in Central Texas and our Sitemap contains an index of different content available. The Privacy Policy provides information on cookies, session data, and site security. It includes the copyright disclosure and disclaimer as well. There are also two buttons on the left hand side that exist on every page. The Up Arrow takes the user to the top of the page while the robot icon opens up a help navigation bot. This bot helps users by directing them to helpful pages based on survey questions, each dependent on the answer's response to the prior question.
