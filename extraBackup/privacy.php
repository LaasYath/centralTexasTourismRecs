            <li> User Data: Any information that is stored long term as a result of an action or input from the user. </li>
            <li> Personal Data: Data revealing personal information about the user, including their name and email. </li>

        <ul> 
            <li> We donâ€™t collect any of your personal data without your consent. Our site is made so that anyone, anywhere, can access our content without the extra hassle of logging in. </li>
            <li> If you choose to fill out the contact form, your name, email, subject, and message input will be sent as an email to our team.

            <li> We solely use functionality cookies. Accepting the use of cookies also allows us to collect user data, but we do not collect any of your personal information.

            <li> We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank"> <u> Secure Mail Transfer Protocol </u> </a> and <a href="https://www.hmailserver.com/" target="_blank"> <u> hMailServer </u> </a> to send and receive all messages safely. </li>
            <li>We also do our best to prevent our website from potential hackers with functions to scan data for malicious code and either replace or delete anything that could potentially harm us or our users. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Third Parties </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> We do not have any integrations or social buttons (third party apps) embedded within our site. No third parties will have access to your information.  </li>
            <li> Our website does contain numerous external websites. As these sites are governed by the privacy policy of third parties, we do not have any jurisdiction over the use of cookies in external sites and will not be held accountable for any ill actions that occur outside of our web domain. We do not encourage or endorse any of the content represented on the external sites unless otherwise stated. </li>

        <h3> User Rights </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Users have the ability to opt out of the use of cookies and sessions on our popup/splash page located on the home page. If you would like to delete previously existing cookie information, users can delete information stored in our cookies and sessions in their own browser. </li>
